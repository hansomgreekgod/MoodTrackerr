# MoodTrackerr
Project : Track your daily mood

'MoodTrackerr' is majorly inspired by Mr. Mood for iOS. The idea is simple: every day, you record your mood within the application. if you want, you can add a note to give more information on why you're feeling a certain way (ex. "I got a new job! ðŸ˜ƒ" or "There was no cheesecake left for dessert ðŸ˜ž "). 

Your mood history is saved for a week, allowing you see your general mood trends. Any comment you've left can also be consulted.
